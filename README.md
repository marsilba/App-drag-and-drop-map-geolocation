Mark the location of the laboratory directly on the map, where the address will be automatically informed.

Enter opening hours, phone numbers and other useful information.

Click save. The lab has been saved for viewing in the app.

<h3>Mobile App</h3>

Open the app and drag the map to the location where you want to check the lab addresses.
All registered laboratories within a radius of 5Km will be displayed on the map.

Just click on the icon on the map and the laboratory data will be displayed, such as: Name, address, telephone and opening hours.
